Welcome to my personal website that I call 'Hack the Ripper' !! I named it so as it rhymes with the notorious [Jack the Ripper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_the_Ripper) and I find this cool.
My name is Jovin Lobo, I often spell my name as 'Jovyn', apparently I find this cool too.  
I made this website to share stuff I find cool and I promise not to repeat 'cool' in any other sentence.    
  
I specialize in web Security and I am currently working as a Security Consultant for [NotSoSecure](https://www.notsosecure.com/).  
I have more than 8 years of experience in the InfoSec domain and of late I have started exploring the fascinating world of DevSecOps.  

I have spoken at conferences like Cocon, nullcon and GNUnify in the past. I am a member of [null - the open security community](https://null.co.in/).
  
I am the author of [GameOver](https://sourceforge.net/projects/null-gameover/) a .iso I had created as a platform with the objective of training and educating newbies about the basics of web security and educate them about the common web attacks and help them understand how they work. Unfortunately I have not been updating or maintaining it.  
  
Cheers !!
